1.HTML Structure (index.html)
The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page.
It includes:
A heading (<h1>Let's Play</h1>) to title the game.
A grid of buttons representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Each button has an ID of "cross", which allows for easy selection and manipulation in JavaScript.
A message area that displays the result of the game (winner or tie) and buttons to start a new game or reset the current game.
The CSS file is linked to style the game.
2. Styling (game.css)
The CSS file provides styles for various elements:
Basic reset for padding and margin.
Styling for the body, main game area, buttons, and message display.
It uses flexbox to center elements and create a responsive layout.
Buttons have specific styles for size, color, and hover effects.
3. Game Logic (game.js)
The JavaScript file contains the logic for the Tic-Tac-Toe game:
It initializes variables to track the game state (e.g., whose turn it is, how many moves have been made).
It defines winning combinations in an array called pairing.
Event listeners are added to each button (representing a cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe grid) to handle player moves.
Players take turns clicking on the buttons, with "O" for the first player and "X" for the second.
The game checks for a winner after each move using the findwinner function, which compares the current state of the buttons against the winning combinations.
If all buttons are filled without a winner, the game declares a tie.
Functions to reset the game and enable/disable buttons are also included.
4. User Interaction
When the game starts, players click on the buttons to make their moves.
The game displays messages indicating the winner or if the game ends in a tie.
Players can reset the game or start a new game using the respective buttons.
Summary
Overall, this project is a straightforward implementation of a classic game, showcasing fundamental web development skills such as HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity. It can serve as a learning tool for beginners to understand how to create interactive web applications.
